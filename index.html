            <h2>About Tyler, The Creator</h2>
            <p>Tyler Gregory Okonma, better known as Tyler, The Creator is an American rapper, record producer, director, actor and fashion designer. The co-founder of the since-disbanded Odd Future collective, Tyler has come to become an icon in the American rap scene.

His discography consists of eight projects. The first two – Bastard (2009) and Goblin (2011) – are known for their more coarse subject matter. After a transition period with Wolf (2013) and Cherry Bomb (2015), the latter of which introduced a bunch of new elements, sounds, and genres to Tyler's sounds, Tyler has achieved mainstream success with his three latest works. Flower Boy (2017) was nominated for the Best Rap Album at the 2018 Grammy Awards, but lost to Damn by Kendrick Lamar. Since then, he has won the category twice with Igor (2019) and Call Me If You Get Lost (2021). On October 28, 2024, he released his eighth project, Chromakopia (2024).
